[French Paper](https://frenchpaper.com) makes gorgeous papers in the Great Lakes region with renewable power.

Price per sheet is based on the minimum purchasable quantity, usually 50 sheets. I don’t have unlimited space to store paper in cheaper bulk quanitties.

## Adhesives

- [Precision craft glue](https://amzn.to/3YDEqX6), acid-free, photo-safe, archival
- [Glue Dots](https://amzn.to/4doJAee), ½" circle stickers double-sided with permanent adhesive

## Folding and measuring

- [Teflon bone folder](https://amzn.to/3SMlq55) for folding/creasing zines
  - Teflon is a little pricier than the standard options, but
    1. it’s an animal-free alternative to bone of unknown origin, and
    2. it doesn’t leave shiny marks on your paper.

## Laser printer

- I use a Brother black-and-white laser printer/scanner. The exact model I have is discontinued, so [check the Wirecutter pick for the current equivalent](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-laser-printer/). I bought mine refurbished in 2016 and it’s still one of my fav purchases ever. I recommend [checking Amazon for “renewed” models](https://amzn.to/3SLWx9z); they’re hard to come across used irl because they’re so reliable.
