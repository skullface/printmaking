# Linocut tools and materials

The tools and materials I use as a new relief printer focused on linocut! The brands and models I use are based on my personal preferences/budget and their availability in the U.S. There are way fancier options and way more affordable/DIY options out there. I choose my tools and materials based on the following criteria:

- Will I need to replace it after a few uses?
- Can I maintain it myself? How difficult is it to do so?
- Is there a more eco-friendly option available?
- Does my local art supply store carry it? Does my local print studio have it?
- If I stop using it, does it have value to be donated to my local print studio or another local artist?

## Paper

| Name                                                | Weight         | Size    | $/sheet |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| [Strathmore 300 newsprint](https://amzn.to/3YHZLPe) | 32T (120 gsm)  | 9x12"   | $0.16   |
| French Paper Kraft-Tone                             | 100C (270 gsm) | 8.5x11" | $0.38   |
| French Paper Speckletone                            | 80C (215 gsm)  | 8.5x11" | $0.33   |
| French Paper Pop-Tone                               | 65C (175 gsm)  | 8.5x11" | $0.26   |
| [Neenah Astrobrights](https://amzn.to/4dmrqK3)      | 60T (90 gsm)   | 8.5x11" | $0.04   |

All papers listed are acid-free.

It’s not a common relief printing choice, but I love [French Paper](https://frenchpaper.com). They make gorgeous papers in the Great Lakes region with renewable power.

Price per sheet is based on the minimum purchasable quantity, usually 50 sheets. I don’t have unlimited space to store paper in cheaper bulk quanitties.

## Linoleum

- Battleship gray linoleum
  - This is the only type of biodegradable lino — you can compost your remnants!
  - Also called “silk cut” linoleum in other parts of the world. It’s not silk though.
  - I avoid the beige and pink “Easy Cut”/“Speedy Carve“ style blocks. Battleship gray is firmer and, thus, easier for me to work with; I don’t feel like I’m fighting against the block to hold detail. Easy Cut blocks are great to play with because they’re cheap, soft, and double-sided. They just don’t work for my style.

I got most of my [Power Grip tools from this 5-piece kit](https://amzn.to/3M2iq0D) ($23) at <$5 per knife, though, admittedly, I don’t reach for the chisels much.

I advocate for folks using the tools they want to, but I can’t recommend the [the popular Speedball beginner cutter set](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ndFbsfxhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) ($15). The 5-piece Power Grip kit costs about $8 more for a much better value: it’s more comfortable in your hand and you can sharpen the blades.

My favorite cutting tools are the Flexcut ones. I’m interested in trying Pfeil, but I have no need to spend that type of money right now.

I use a [Flexcut Slipstrop](https://amzn.to/46KZrkE) to sharpen my blades after every few hours of use.

## Bench hook

_Still looking for my favorite. Currently switching between the Speedball metal bench hook/ink tray and Essdee wooden 30x20cm bench hook. I think I’ll eventually need to make my own to work with blocks up to 10x10"._

## Inks

### Cranfield Caligo Safe Wash Relief Inks

Oil-based ink that washes off with soap and water instead of requiring messy cleanup (like traditional oil-based inks). The downside: dry time takes days instead of minutes.

- Process Blue (Cyan)
- Process Red (Magenta)
- Process Yellow
- Black
- Opaque White
- Extender (Transparent base modifier, add to your ink for translucency)
- Printmakers Wax Drier (Drying modifier, add to your ink to dry faster)

[Blick via Amazon has set of 4 the process colors + white + the extender](https://amzn.to/3WI4VrW) in smaller 75mL sizes for about $6 cheaper than buying each tube individually.

### Speedball Water-Soluble Block Printing Inks

Water-based ink that cleans up with just water. These are affordable and readily-available beginner inks. The downside: They can dry _too quickly_ and do not produce consistent results. I like the tiny 37 mL tubes so I can test out colors cheaply from my local supply store or through [Blick](https://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-water-soluble-block-printing-inks/). Seasoned printmakers hate this stuff, but I don’t mind it at all to make something quick and not-so-dirty.

## Inking

### Inking slab

- [Acrylic glass board (12x24")](https://amzn.to/3Aqmcyf)
  - You could use thrifted picture frame glass/acrylic or other plexiglass/perspex… but I prefer a _big_, sturdy surface because I’m messy!

### Brayers

- [6" Speedball Deluxe Soft Rubber Brayer](https://amzn.to/4dZJzgL)
- [4" Speedball Pop-In Soft Rubber Brayer](https://amzn.to/4cnDpWs)
- [2" Speedball Deluxe Soft Rubber Brayer](https://amzn.to/4dZJzgL)
- [1.5" Speedball Deluxe Soft Rubber Brayer](https://amzn.to/4cnDpWs)

## Burnishing

- [Speedball Red Baron baren](https://amzn.to/3SHLTQX) for handprinting
- [Woodzilla A4 press](https://www.speedballart.com/product/woodzilla-presses) as a modern tabletop press

## Transferring

- [Blue carbon transfer paper (8.5x11")](https://amzn.to/3SOHcoN) to transfer mirrored art to lino, $0.04/sheet
- [Strathmore 300 tracing paper (9x12")](https://amzn.to/3SOHcoN), $0.16/sheet
  - There are cheaper options, but this one is fairly heavy (25lb text, 41 gsm) with good translucency and it won’t tear/wrinkle at the slightest tug. Not acid-free, but I don’t care for this purpose.

## Laser printer

- I use a Brother black-and-white laser printer/scanner for all my home printing needs (mostly to transfer to lino blocks). The [exact model](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/hll2380dw) I have is discontinued, so [check the Wirecutter pick for the current equivalent](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-laser-printer/). I bought mine refurbished in 2016 and it’s still one of my fav purchases ever to this day in 2024. I recommend [checking Amazon for “renewed” models](https://amzn.to/3SLWx9z); they’re hard to come across used irl because they’re so reliable.

## Cleaning

- Dollar store soft sponges and medium bristle scrub brush
- Dish soap to clean ink off hands, inking slab, blocks, and brayers
- Crisco/cheap veggie oil or Simple Green to scrub any more stubborn ink off tools and hands
