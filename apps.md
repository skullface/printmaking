# Apps

## iPadOS

- Procreate, the best $13 you can spend on an app
  - Fav brushes TK :)

## MacOS

- [Spectrolite](https://spectrolite.app/) for risograph-specific color separation
  - I tend to use Photoshop for my final color separations for the most control. I use Spectrolite as a great (free!) tool to help visualize separations using the specific riso inks available to me.

## Desktop (Windows or MacOS)

- Photoshop for photo editing and color separation
- Illustrator for page layout and vector illustration
- Electric Zine Maker for layout
